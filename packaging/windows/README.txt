Jarvis 1.2.0 — Windows x64

Windows 10 22H2 and Windows 11 x64. Run Jarvis-1.2.0-Windows-x64-Setup.exe:
it installs for your account only, needs no administrator rights, downloads
nothing and does not restart Windows. Setup upgrades an earlier Jarvis in
place and keeps settings and recordings. Optional: desktop shortcut (on by
default) and start at sign-in (on by default).

Portable ZIP: extract the whole folder before opening Jarvis.exe. Keep
JarvisConsole.exe, _internal, models and tools beside it.

Open Jarvis.exe to start. Fresh installs enable wake listening and instant replay;
Mute is one click away. Models are included; normal use needs no downloads or paid service.
The notification-area icon remains while the service runs. Its menu can mute,
listen once, save replay, stop recording or quit the service.

Recording: select a display and folder, review system/microphone switches,
then start capture. Settings apply as they change. Choose H.264 if you need broad playback support. At 8 Mbps, the
video budget is about 60 MB per minute plus sound/container overhead. HEVC
and AV1 usually offer better compression but need compatible graphics hardware
and playback software. CPU H.264 is an explicit compatibility option.

Replay defaults to RAM, capped by history and the encoded-video budget
(256 MiB by default). Other process and in-flight/save memory is additional.
Explicit Disk mode continuously writes unsaved screen and selected audio to
a private rolling buffer, including microphone audio when enabled. Writes
follow bitrate (roughly 1–10 GB/hour; 8 Mbps is 3.6 GB/hour plus overhead).
Stop deletes buffers; crash leftovers are cleaned on next replay start.
Deletion is not secure erasure. Disk mode needs the included Rust helper and
a local NTFS/ReFS disk; its byte cap includes pending and save-pinned files.
Saving completes the current second and may include one later second.

Settings/logs: %LOCALAPPDATA%\Jarvis
Recordings: the folder you selected (default %USERPROFILE%\Videos\Jarvis).
Portable mode keeps account settings in the same location as the installer.
Uninstall preserves account settings and recordings unless you tick
"Also delete my Jarvis settings and logs". Recordings are never deleted.

Speech recognition runs in tools\jarvis-voice.exe (native, offline). If
Windows blocks the microphone, turn on Settings > Privacy > Microphone >
"Let desktop apps access your microphone".

Console examples:
  JarvisConsole.exe --version
  JarvisConsole.exe startup on|off
  JarvisConsole.exe doctor
  JarvisConsole.exe status
  JarvisConsole.exe mute
  JarvisConsole.exe shutdown

No Discord moderation is included. The same Windows app can still be opened
by name like other installed applications.

New in 1.2.0: tick the sound outputs (up to six) and microphones (up to four)
to record right under System sound and Microphone on Capture > Recording, each
on its own track, instead of the Windows default ones. System sound stays in
step with the video during long replays. Clips play inside Jarvis (Clips >
Watch and edit) with sound, frame steps and Mark start / Mark end for cutting.

New in 1.1.0: automatic video format selection (AV1, HEVC, then H.264),
quality presets up to 240 fps, corrected replay sync, improved HDR capture,
faster GPU clip exports, fast-speech retries, six settings themes, and start
at sign-in synchronized with Windows Startup apps.

Recording audio: choose All audio, or Specific apps for the running game,
up to four programs and the microphone. Each has a volume; Separate audio
tracks keeps them individually alongside a combined track. Specific-app
capture requires Windows 11 (build 20348 or later).
Arabic recognition uses an optional model download; English models are bundled.

Validation details for this build are on the v1.2 GitHub release page.
The contributor tested the Windows changes on Windows 11 with an RTX 5080.
Automated and Wine checks do not establish behavior on every GPU, display
or microphone. This build is unsigned; Windows may show a SmartScreen warning.
